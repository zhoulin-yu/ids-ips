Electron is a framework that enables you to create desktop applications with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. These applications can then be packaged to run directly on macOS, Windows, or Linux, or distributed via the Mac App Store or the Microsoft Store.

Typically, you create a desktop application for an operating system (OS) using each operating system's specific native application frameworks. Electron makes it possible to write your application once using technologies that you already know.

Prerequisites

Before proceeding with Electron you need to install Node.js. We recommend that you install either the latest LTS or Current version available.

Please install Node.js using pre-built installers for your platform. You may encounter incompatibility issues with different development tools otherwise.
